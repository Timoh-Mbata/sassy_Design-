Explanation of Key Components
Frontend (React App)

The frontend directory contains the React application for the user interface. It is structured with reusable components such as product cards, buttons, and a shopping cart. The App.js file acts as the main entry point for the frontend.
The public/index.html file serves as the root HTML page, while the manifest.json file ensures the platform is also a Progressive Web App (PWA).
The React pages directory houses different views, such as the homepage, product listings, product details, and checkout pages.
The styles directory contains the CSS or SCSS files that style the website.
Backend (Django or Flask API)

The backend folder contains the server-side application, which could be built with Django (as described) or Flask. It manages routing, user authentication, product listings, order processing, and database interactions.
The assydesign/ directory contains core Django app files such as settings (settings.py), URLs (urls.py), and the WSGI entry point (wsgi.py).
The apps/ subdirectory contains specific applications for managing users, products, orders, and reviews. These modules handle the business logic and data management.
The templates folder can be used for rendering HTML templates that are dynamically populated with product data or user information.
Database (SQL Schema & Migrations)

The schema.sql file defines the structure of the database, outlining tables, columns, and relationships. This is essential for setting up the product catalog, user data, and order history.
The migrations/ directory contains scripts for updating the database schema as the application evolves.
Docker & Docker Compose

The Dockerfile configures the environment in which the backend will run, defining necessary dependencies, the Python environment, and server setup.
The docker-compose.yml file simplifies running the application with multiple services, allowing you to spin up containers for the frontend, backend, and database with a single command.
Additional Files

The README.md file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and setup guidelines.
The .gitignore file ensures that files like node_modules/, venv/, and other temporary files are excluded from version control.
How SASSYDESIGN Works
SASSYDESIGN is an e-commerce platform that offers a range of fashion products and sneakers to its users. By using the dropshipping model, I am able to sell products directly from suppliers without holding inventory. This allows me to offer a wide variety of items without needing large upfront capital for purchasing stock.

The platform features:

Product Listings: Customers can browse a wide range of fashion items and sneakers, with detailed product descriptions and pricing.
Dropshipping Model: Products are shipped directly from the supplier to the customer, eliminating the need for storage and inventory management.
User Interactions: Customers can leave reviews, comment on products, and ask questions, making the shopping experience more interactive.
Personalized Experience: With a carefully curated selection of products, SASSYDESIGN provides a tailored experience for users based on their preferences.
Bridging Education and Entrepreneurship
